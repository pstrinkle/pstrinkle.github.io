So, I thought it'd be fun to actually try and breakout my professional history into years for each technology.  
The idea being, excluding school and non-paid-non-professional time, how much have I spent working on each programming language
 or process over the years.  It was an interesting exercise that left a pretty graph and provided a couple surprises for me.

<ol>
<li> I found a bug in my resume timeline, that appears to have been in the copy of my resume sent out.  So that is lame, but fixed.</li>
<li> I found that I've been working in Python a lot longer than I had thought.</li>
</ol>

Something that <strong>isn't</strong> a surprise:
<ol>
<li> The graph it produced is misleading and mostly worthless because although it captures raw years where I was working in a technology
or technologies it may not be a good reflection of my career or experience.  It is mostly correct, but I'm not sure I'd ever use it to
drawn any conclusions, and I wouldn't want anyone else to, so I'm including here for posterity and otherwise likely removing it</li>
</ol>
