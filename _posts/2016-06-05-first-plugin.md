title: "First jQuery Plugin"

I've been playing around with various fun JavaScripts I've written recently and also some fun 
ideas I've had over the years, and today I took one of them and made it into a jQuery plugin, and
put it into its own public repo [jquery-levelup](https://github.com/pstrinkle/jquery-levelup).  I'm pretty nervous
to publish something, but that's part of life and developing in open source: exposing yourself to ridicule.
Once something you spent time on, be it a book or a painting, or a program is in the public eye, you open
yourself up to the opinions of others and are vulnerable.  However, this is part of growth.

I'm going into this with my eyes open and nervous and hopefully people will start using it and providing
feedback.  I have some immediate ideas on things I'd like to improve right off the bat, and so the adventure begins.
