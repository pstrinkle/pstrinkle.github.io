After being nervous about publishing my first open source jQuery plugin, I've 
effectively gotten addicted to it.  I keep turning ideas into plugins and 
releasing them.  It's so fun.  I am sure I'll run out of ideas soon, but for 
the time being, I keep thinking of new fun things to code.  Adn then, once it's
halfway finished I port it into a plugin and publish it.  Then I create issues
and start fixing bugs and updating it.  So far, I haven't made any waves with
my development, but that's no surprise.  It's been a day or two, but I don't
imagine they'll ever garner too much activity.  Maybe some day.  But that's not
why I write them.  They're fun and nothing like what I do for my day job.

This is my hobby. :D
