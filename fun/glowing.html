<p>As the mouse approaches the button, it glows.  When I first started, I was told this would be a fun project, but I never
made time for it.  This will be my first attempt at it.  While making a button glow really seems like the most difficult aspect
of this.</p>

<div class="row">
  <button class="btn btn-default" type="submit">Button</button>
</div>

<div class="row" id='where'>
  
</div>

<script>
  $(function() {
    document.mousemove(function(event) {
      $('#where').text(event.pageX + ", " + event.pageY);
    })
  });
</script>
